# LifePredict
LifePredict is a deep learning-based disease detection system built using Streamlit. It allows users to detect diseases like breast cancer, brain tumors, and kidney disease using AI-powered models. The application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can upload medical images and receive predictions. The system is designed to assist in early disease detection, helping medical professionals and patients make informed decisions.

#Features
1.Deep Learning-Based Predictions: Uses trained AI models to detect diseases with high accuracy.
2.User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for seamless navigation and ease of use.
3.Multiple Disease Detection: Supports classification of breast cancer, brain tumors, and kidney disease.
4.Fast and Reliable: Provides quick results with confidence scores to help users assess prediction reliability.

#Installation
To set up LifePredict on your local system, follow these steps:

- Dataset
The AI models used in LifePredict are trained on publicly available datasets for breast cancer, brain tumors, and kidney disease. Extensive preprocessing techniques, including image augmentation and normalization, are applied to improve model accuracy and robustness. The deep learning models are fine-tuned to provide reliable and precise classifications.

-Usage
1. "Select a disease" from the dropdown menu.
2. Upload the relevant medical image (such as an X-ray, MRI, or histopathology slide).
3. Click the 'Predict' button to initiate the AI modelâ€™s analysis.
4. View the prediction results, including the confidence score and classification outcome.
5. Interpret the results and consider further consultation with a medical expert if needed.
